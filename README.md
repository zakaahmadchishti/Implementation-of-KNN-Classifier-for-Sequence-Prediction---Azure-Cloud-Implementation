## Introduction:
This section presents the overview of implementing the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine learning algorithm for predicting outcome variables based on input variables. Leveraging the capabilities of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) for learning complex temporal patterns, our study focuses on predicting sequences of random sequences between 0-48 floating numbers. We integrate the KNN model with the Neocortex API to efficiently classify sequences, now deployed on the Azure Cloud.

The KNN model receives input data as Sparse Distributed Representations (SDR) from HTM stored in the Container Blob Storage. We construct a dataset comprising multiple sequence SDRs, each with varying values within a defined threshold. To segregate data, we have two storage containers named trainingdata and testingdata, and one container for output. All of these details are discussed below.

#### KNN Architecture - SE Project 
The KNN implementation is divided into three main components. The first and primary component is the KNNClassifier class, which includes the key methods: distance, vote, and classify. The second component is the IndexAndDistance class, responsible for managing the indices and distances of data points. The third component, also part of the KNNClassifier, includes methods to handle classification tasks.

	•	The distance method calculates the distance between a new, unlabeled data point and the existing data points.
	•	The vote method creates a voting table based on the calculated distance matrix, determining the most likely class for the new data point.
	•	The classify method uses the results from the vote method to assign a class label to the unknown data point.

It’s important to note that we are using JSON files as our dataset, with multiple file inputs as discussed in the CC Project’s Project Implementation Section.

The diagram illustrates the processes of training and testing a KNN classifier using random sequences. In the training phase, a set of 200 random sequences is created. This will be our starting point. These sequences undergo encoded sequences and spatial pooling to create Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs), which form the features and labels of the training dataset. The KNN classifier is trained on this dataset by calculating distances, selecting nearest neighbors, and using a voting mechanism to determine class labels. In the testing phase, a separate set of random sequences is processed (Which we selected from our 200 random sequences) similarly to generate testing data SDRs. These features are classified by the trained KNN model, which predicts the class labels based on the learned patterns. The accuracy of these predictions is then evaluated, with higher accuracy expected if most of the training labels are consistent with the testing labels.

## Project Implementation
Before proceeding, it’s important to highlight the changes made in this project compared to the previous SE Project. The key update is in the input file structure for training and testing. Initially, we used a single input file for all the data. However, due to the need for a larger dataset, we have now transitioned to using multiple input files in the form of JSON files. Previously, the SE Project utilized only three types of sequence classes as input data. In contrast, the current project has expanded to 200 sequence classes, with each sequence stored in a separate JSON file. This means we now have 200 JSON files, with each sequence class containing 10 attributes. An example of one of these JSON files is provided in the Input File Section.

The Important components are the input files and the queue which are discussed in the below sections. 



### Input Files (Training Data)
We are using 200 JSON Files in the Project. Which are used as the training dataset. These 200 Files(JSON) means we have 200 sequences and every sequence has 10 attributes(SDRs). Below is the one JSON File sample. 


```json
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[4898,5102,5461,6476,6640,6702,6884,6923,7034,7072,7077,7128,7170,7226,7598,8002,8177,8431,8504,8559]}
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[4898,5102,5461,6476,6640,6702,6884,6923,7034,7072,7077,7128,7170,7226,7598,8002,8177,8431,8504,8559]}
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[5344,5399,5417,5529,6406,6464,6775,6848,7021,7034,7117,7234,7351,7411,7511,7534,7608,7686,7913,8128]}
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[5344,5399,5417,5529,6406,6464,6775,6848,7021,7034,7117,7234,7351,7411,7511,7534,7608,7686,7913,8128]}
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[4615,5599,5944,6610,6657,6691,6991,7170,7187,7257,7319,7331,7389,7508,7535,7590,7618,7698,7960,8185]}
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[4615,5599,5944,6610,6657,6691,6991,7170,7187,7257,7319,7331,7389,7508,7535,7590,7618,7698,7960,8185]}
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[5564,5604,6292,6321,6517,6525,6630,6879,7036,7056,7173,7218,7239,7256,7394,7439,7542,7556,7671,7973]}
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[5564,5604,6292,6321,6517,6525,6630,6879,7036,7056,7173,7218,7239,7256,7394,7439,7542,7556,7671,7973]}
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[5457,6462,6718,6773,6780,6860,6941,7012,7068,7077,7136,7233,7309,7331,7526,7613,7644,7658,7912,8433]}
{"SequenceName":"S1","SequenceData":[5457,6462,6718,6773,6780,6860,6941,7012,7068,7077,7136,7233,7309,7331,7526,7613,7644,7658,7912,8433]}

```
The above sequence represents the S1 Sequence-Type and has 10 attributes(SDRs). Next, the below, code below shows the representation of reading files and then separating the label and SDRs. Which are used further to calculate K-Nearest. 

```csharp
            List<SequenceDataEntry> sequenceDataEntriestraining = new List<SequenceDataEntry>();
            List<SequenceDataEntry> sequenceDataEntriestesting = new List<SequenceDataEntry>();

            // Load all files from the training folder and add to the training data list
            foreach (string trainingfile in Directory.GetFiles(trainingFolder, "*.json"))
            {
                sequenceDataEntriestraining.AddRange(classifierleaning.LoadDataset(trainingfile));
            }
            // Load the testing file
            sequenceDataEntriestesting.AddRange(classifierleaning.LoadDataset(testingfile));
            // Extract the training data labels and features.
            Classifierleaning.Featursandlabel(sequenceDataEntriestraining, out List<List<double>> trainingFeatures, out List<string> trainingLabels);
            // Extract the testing data labels and features.
            Classifierleaning.Featursandlabel(sequenceDataEntriestesting, out List<List<double>> testingFeatures, out List<string> testingLabels);
```

Below is the reference to the training data used in the project.

### Input (Testing Data)  
The testing data are random sequences which we will test and determine in which class they will fall. As below we have shown one of the sample formats of testing data. Against every sequence, votes are calculated and determined on a voting basis which is the nearest sequence from the training data. 


```json
{"SequenceName":"S152","SequenceData":[12961,14365,14418,14447,14468,14517,14747,14774,14788,14957,14998,15001,15029,15083,15132,15443,15484,15532,15584,15772]}
{"SequenceName":"S178","SequenceData":[20094,21326,21524,21576,21668,21834,21916,21925,21971,22007,22268,22278,22307,22333,22390,22564,22752,22851,22958,23795]}
{"SequenceName":"S180","SequenceData":[9274,9332,9401,9957,10035,10069,10089,10348,10379,10442,10642,10675,10724,10809,10865,11114,11334,11806,12020,12124]}
{"SequenceName":"S153","SequenceData":[14331,14368,14405,14464,14512,14963,14980,15085,15136,15180,15263,15331,15371,15429,15479,15534,15552,15585,15717,15774]}
{"SequenceName":"S179","SequenceData":[5157,5646,5767,6074,6699,6862,6884,7133,7157,7209,7296,7371,7534,7749,7873,7933,7995,8094,8110,8479]}
```

As these SDRs are random, KNN finds the one with high votes. Select the closest to the specific class. We have created multiple test files similar to those shown above which are used as our testing data. 



```csharp
InputFiles = "https://github.com/UniversityOfAppliedSciencesFrankfurt/se-cloud-2023-2024/tree/8d539862a2339650f3ede381964211e3956d3fcb/Myproject/KNN/dataset/testingdatafolder",
 //See project Training Dataset for more information

### Triggering Input (Queue)
The main purpose behind using the Queue is to store and retrieve messages. This queue likely triggers processing or workflows related to your KNN algorithm or other tasks. Below is the Message Format of our Queue. We have created two cases. The first case considered specific test files and in the second case all of the testing files were used. Examples are shown below. 

Case 1: Using ALL Testing Files:
In the First case, we have to give the specific file number. So that only that specific file will be used for testing. 

```json
{
  "ExperimentId": "1",
  "Name": "KNN Classifier Prediction",
  "Description": "KNN Classifier",
  "TrainingDataFile": "ALL",
  "TestingDataFile": "testfile1.json"
}
```

</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 5: Queue (Triggering Input) (</em>
</p>


Case 2: Using Single Testing File.
Below is the JSON format when we are using the ALL Files as the testing dataset. 

```json
{
  "ExperimentId": "2",
  "Name": "KNN Classifier Prediction",
  "Description": "KNN Classifier",
  "TrainingDataFile": "ALL",
  "TestingDataFile": "ALL"
}
```


ExperimentRequestMessage Method which is defined in ExerimentRequestMessage.cs. 

```csharp
 public ExperimentRequestMessage(
   string experimentId,
   string trainingDataFile,
   string testingDataFile,
   string name,
   string description,
   string messageId,
   string messageReceipt)
    {
     ExperimentId = experimentId ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(experimentId));
     TrainingDataFile = trainingDataFile ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(trainingDataFile));
     TestingDataFile = testingDataFile ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(testingDataFile));
     Name = name ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(name));
     Description = description;
     MessageId = messageId ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(messageId));
     MessageReceipt = messageReceipt ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(messageReceipt));
        }
    }
```


### Algorithm Background and Operations
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, instance-based learning method primarily used for classification and regression. It operates on the principle of similarity, where the output is determined by the ‘k’ most similar instances (neighbors) in the dataset.

In the SE project, the input data is represented as Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) generated by the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) model. The algorithm calculates the distance between data points using various metrics like Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, or Hamming distance, which influences the accuracy and performance of the model. Well, we only used Euclidean. For classification tasks, KNN assigns a class to a data point based on the majority vote among its ‘k’ nearest neighbors. For regression tasks, the output is the average of the values of ‘k’ nearest neighbors. The value of ‘k’ is crucial; a smaller ‘k’ can lead to overfitting, while a larger ‘k’ can result in underfitting. Cross-validation is often used to find the optimal ‘k’.

The project integrates KNN with the HTM model, where HTM generates SDRs that serve as input to the KNN classifier. The dataset consists of multiple sequence SDRs of a random sequences, split into training data and testing data. The KNN model processes sequence SDRs and achieves high accuracy rates. The primary use case in this project is the classification of random sequences (in 200 Classes). The integration with the Neocortex API enhances the model’s efficiency in classifying sequences.

KNN is simple and effective for various classification tasks, robust with respect to different data types and distributions. However, it is computationally intensive for large datasets, sensitive to the choice of ‘k’ and distance metrics, and can struggle with imbalanced datasets. The KNN algorithm, when combined with HTM and SDRs, demonstrates high accuracy in sequence classification tasks, showcasing the potential for improved predictive performance in various machine learning applications.

As already discussed, the main difference is dataset is changed in the CC Project. We have extended our dataset.

## Future Scope
One area of focus could be scalability and optimization, which includes performance tuning to handle larger datasets and reduce computation time, as well as implementing parallel processing techniques to speed up the KNN classification. Additionally, integrating the KNN classifier with other machine learning models, such as combining it with neural networks or decision trees to create hybrid models, can offer better accuracy and robustness. Incorporating Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools to automatically select the best model and hyperparameters for different datasets is another avenue for future development. Furthermore, exploring advanced distance metrics could improve the classifier’s performance by finding more appropriate measures for specific types of data. Expanding the range of applications by adapting the KNN classifier for different domains, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and real-time analytics, can also broaden the project’s impact. Finally, enhancing the user interface and user experience for managing and monitoring the classification process in the cloud will make the system more user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience.



## Conclusion
The implementation of the KNN Classifier for random sequence prediction is a significant step toward predicting sequence classes with high accuracy. This project showcases the successful integration of the KNN algorithm into a cloud environment using Azure services, future improvements can provide us with a scalable, reliable, and efficient solution for large-scale sequence prediction.
